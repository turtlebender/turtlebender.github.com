    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been fighting all week with configuring uwsgi to work with both
python (wsgi) and ruby (rack) apps.  The python was no problem.
Honestly, the rack stuff wasn&#8217;t too bad once you sort out the
dependencies.  The real problem I faced was that I manage my rack apps
using bundler, and it is certainly not obvious how to make that work.  I
had actually given up, but then found disturbingly suddent success when
I was waiting for something else to complete.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so this is a kinda small thing, but it is a nice little pattern that
I used a lot today while building an oauth 2.0 server for
https://www.globusonline.org  I often need to make sure that a
particular exception was thrown, as part of my &#8220;unhappy&#8221; testing.  This
is always a little bit of a pain.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>test.py </span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_me</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertRaises</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">NodeNotFoundException</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="k">lambda</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">storage</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get_node</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;access_token&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>     <span class="n">access_token_data</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">&#39;id&#39;</span><span class="p">]))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Sticking that lambda in there makes it really easy to check for an
exception.  Groundbreaking?  No.  But very convenient.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is not hugely inspiring, but my goal is to start blogging with far
more frequency.  Since my life is largely steeped in github these days,
I figured github and octopress would be an appropriate way to approach it.
I&#8217;m not much of a designer, so I&#8217;m going to rely on other people&#8217;s
templates for the most part.  I am really enjoying building my blog
posts in vim, though and the automatic version control is excellent.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all, until I figure out some more stuff.</p>
