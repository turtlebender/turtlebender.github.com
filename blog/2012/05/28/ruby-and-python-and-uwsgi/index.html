<p>I&#8217;ve been fighting all week with configuring uwsgi to work with both
python (wsgi) and ruby (rack) apps.  The python was no problem.
Honestly, the rack stuff wasn&#8217;t too bad once you sort out the
dependencies.  The real problem I faced was that I manage my rack apps
using bundler, and it is certainly not obvious how to make that work.  I
had actually given up, but then found disturbingly suddent success when
I was waiting for something else to complete.</p>
