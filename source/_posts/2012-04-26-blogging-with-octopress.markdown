This is not hugely inspiring, but my goal is to start blogging with far
more frequency.  Since my life is largely steeped in github these days,
I figured github and octopress would be an appropriate way to approach it.
I'm not much of a designer, so I'm going to rely on other people's
templates for the most part.  I am really enjoying building my blog
posts in vim, though and the automatic version control is excellent.

That's all, until I figure out some more stuff.
